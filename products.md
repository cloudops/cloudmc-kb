# Products

## Summary

## Detailed overview

A `product` represents a consumable resource whose usage CloudMC will meter and charge for. Products are created within a `product category` \(e.g., *Compute*, *Networking*, *Storage*, etc\), which in turn is created inside a `product catalog`. To add a new product or to modify an existing product, you must edit or create a product catalog and then create the product within the catalog.

A product may be associated with tax code, which will be used when calculating sales tax on an invoice. Also, a name and a stock keeping unit \(SKU\) is required for every product so that it can be uniquely identified.

The system provides two important mechanisms for refining the product definition: *transformations* and *filters*. A transformation can be applied to modify the raw usage. Both filters and transformers support an expression using the SpEL DSL. SpEL \(Spring expression language\) for taking in a string expression and evaluating it.

- Fields can be captured to be the attribute of the usage \(eg, capture the vCPU usage for my vCPU product\) <-- I don't understand this part. Actually, I do understand now, it just means that a field in a usage record can also be used as the attribute. I think this is useful for writing filters using the value of attributes.

- COGS and unit price should be set for every product. However, the product definition does not contain any cost or pricing information.

A product exists only within a product catalog. A product does not exist outside of a catalog. A product is added or modified by editing a product catalog. Removing a catalog will remove all products from the pricing.

If you have a license \(0 or 1\)

A product by itself has no price or currency.

yes we doâ€¦ use we SPEL expression and you can use the rawUsage and attributeValue if you are using let say the memory of a vm

Perfect! Oh yes I came across the choice of SPEL in one of the design docs. And yes, I've seen rawUsage in an example transformation \(rawUsage / 1024\), but I didn't know about attributeValue. That's great, thank you my friend :smile:
