# Credits

A credit is an amount of money that a customer has access to inside the platform. When using resources on the platform, the cost of those resources are deducted from the credits they have. It is important to note that credits should be automatically configured for an organization once they are onboarded. This will depend on the offer they selected.

Credits are automatically applied for a user when calculating reports / invoices.

Credits have an expiry date associated to them. For example, the credit must be used in the following three months.

Can be recurring, eg I get 300$ credits every year.

Credits will only be displayed on reports on the monthly invoice. No need for hour-to-hour tracking.

Credits are applied per billing cycle with the caveat of org-specific recurring discounts.

These are matched with a pricing to make a package.

Need to be able to track how much of your credit you use per month, if for example you have a 3 month credit, so something will have to be persisted. A credit that lasts 3 months is different than a 300$ credit monthly.

Discounts and credits should be applied at the end of the billing cycle.

Discounts and credits will be displayed on the organization details page. High-level visibility.

Currently the duration begins right at the first time you get the credit applied \(ie the first billing period you actually consume that category or product type\).

There are alternative ways to mark the start time.

Credits if contained in the billing period apply to the entire invoice.

Credits are carried over to the next month until the duration of the credit is over. Once over, the credits are lost.

Discounts are pre-tax and credits are post-tax.

200$ no strings attached. 200$ that can be used on anything in the application.

100$ on edge database. 100$ that can be used for edge database features.

Credits for an SP-1 \(per SKU/per Product\). Set credits for a specific product.
