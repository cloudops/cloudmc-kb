An instance template is a reusable configuration for virtual machines. When users launch instances, they can choose from a list of templates in cloud.ca.

More specifically, an instance template is a virtual disk image that includes one of a variety of operating systems, optional additional software such as office applications, settings such as access control to determine who can use the template, and personalized scripts to enable full application deployment automation. These templates can be used repeatedly to create new instances configured with those settings.
