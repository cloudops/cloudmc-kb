# Basic setup

This basic setup guide assumes you are familiar with how to log into the CloudMC platform. To get your pricing package into effect as quickly as possible, execute the tasks in this article in the presented order.

1.  [Add a new product catalog](create_product_catalog.md#).

    In this step, you will add a new, empty product catalog, and you will also create a product category.

2.  [Add a new product](create_a_product.md#).

    This step will add a new product to your product catalog.

3.  Define pricings for your product:

    |Type of pricing|Description of pricing|
    |---------------|----------------------|
    |**[Add a new pricing](add_a_pricing.md#)**|Choose this procedure to assign a constant price for usage of a product.|
    |**[Add a new tiered pricing](add_a_new_tiered_pricing.md#)**|Choose this procedure to assign price tiers that change as usage of a product increases.|
    |**[Add a new flat tiered pricing](add_a_new_flat_tiered_pricing.md#)**|Choose this procedure to assign price tiers with a flat rate for all usage within a tier.|

4.  [Add a discount](offer_a_limited_time_discount.md).

5.  [Add a credit](add_a_credit.md).

6.  [Add a new pricing package](add_a_new_pricing_package.md).

    This step will use the pricing you created, and associate it with optional discounts and credits.

7.  Apply the pricing package to your organization.

    This is the final step, and will make the pricing package effective as of the start date specified in the pricing package. Usage in the target organization will be charged at the defined rates.
