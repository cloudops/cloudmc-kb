# Pricing

## Summary

In the CloudMC monetization model, the prices of products, known as *pricings*, are defined separately from the product itself. This allows a given pricing to be applied across multiple service connections and to different pricing packages. The pricing information includes the cost of goods sold \(COGS\), which enables the platform to calculate the profit or loss generated by each product.

## Detailed overview

A pricing is a set of prices and cost of goods sold for products from one or more product catalogs. The pricing is configured with an effective starting date and is applied on each customer for the entirety of a billing cycle. If you change pricing in the middle of the billing cycle then it is retroactively applied to the beginning of the cycle. One or more currencies may be selected for a pricing. Pricings have the unique property that once a pricing is defined, it can only be modified by introducing changes, which have an effective start date.

Once a pricing has been defined, it stays defined and any modifications to prices of a product have to be introduced as changes.

- Pricing tiers

- Should be able to price products from any product catalog you have access to.

- Changes to products should propagate to pricings.

- Resellers should be able to create their own pricings.

- Should be able to price selected products from catalogs.

- Deleting pricings should recalculate the records.

- Should be able to select all the currencies you want a price set.

- Should be able to set the COGS \(cost of good sold\) so that you can track the profit you're making. What is your COGS is tiered, do we support that?

- Dates are in UTC.

- Listings of pricings mentions the catalogs used and the currencies that are supported by the pricing.

- When adding a pricing, you can define the source catalogs of the pricing, the supported currencies, and the start date of the pricing. A pricing can incorporate products from multiple product catalogs.

- With pricing 2.0, you can only put a constant price on a product.

- Records will be created based on that constant price no matter what the usage is.

- Pricing tiers are the idea that a different price can be applied depending on the usage of a customer.

- Basically charging different rates for different ranges of usage.

- Significantly different from a resource commitment.

- Pricing tiers are based on usage

- It can be a range

- It can be anything "below than"

- It can be anything "bigger than"

- Can also specify something is free for a specific range \(cool!\)

- Must be able to change a pricing tier with the Changes feature <-- What is this Changes feature?

- Reported in the reports page

- Should be able to specify a flat fee on a specific tier

- For example, 10$ for 1M requests, 5$ for each 1M more

- Typical use cases

- Half-open ranges \(inclusive start, exclusive end\)

- 5$ per GB for the first 100GB, 2$ per GB thereafter

- 10$ for 1M requests, 5$ for each 1M more

- 10$ for 1M requests, 0.01$ per request thereafter

- First 2 vCPUs free, after that 1$ per vCPU-hour

- Gauge spanning multiple tiers: A case where a single usage record spans multiple pricing tiers

- First 5 vCPUs get charged at the first rate, then the 2nd set of 5 at the second rate

- Charges for "feature enablement"

- A reseller might want to charge just for having access to a feature even if there is no usage reported by the service

- Enabling Edge Compute costs 10$ and includes 2 free vCPUs. After that, it costs 1$ per vCPU-hour.

- Rephrasing some use cases:

- No pricing tiers

- Regular pricing tiers with ranges

- Tiers with flat pricing and incremental blocks/chunks

- Tiers with flat pricing and incremental unit \(?\)

- Gauge pricing

- Feature enablement

- No gaps allowed between intervals. A tier must be defined for all possible intervals.

- No overlap between ranges or intervals.

- If a PricedProduct is deleted, then all associated PriceTiers are deleted. A PriceTier cannot exist without a PricedProduct.

- The Pricing form has an Enable Tiering action button.

- Possible errors:

1. Conflicting range, you have already inputted a tier from \_ GB to \_ GB

1. Invalid range, the lower limit should be less than the upper limit

1. Invalid range, no negative values

1. Invalid range, there are gaps in your ranges

1. Invalid ranges, your ranges are out of order

- How to deal with an org that has multiple pricing models applied to them? Which one will be the default one for running a report? \(Especially when there's not a common pricing model that applies to all selected orgs?\) <-- I don't quite understand this.

- This could be dealt with in one of two ways:

1. Derive the "default" pricing for an org to be the one that is defined with the narrowest scope.

1. Add a way to manually set the "default" pricing for an org when more than one applies.

- From a usability standpoint, it would be nice to pre-select the most-fitting pricing model given the scenario at hand.

- In some cases, there might not be a pricing model that applied to the set of orgs selected for a report, in this case, we might want to split the report into multiple sections \(one per pricing models\) and identify how many orgs fall into each section.

- A pricing is applied on each customer for the entirety of a billing cycle. If you change pricing in the middle of the billing cycle then it retroactively applied to the beginning of the cycle.

- Pricing tiers changes will only be applied on the next billing cycle of a customer.

Need a section on pricing changes

In pricing changes, need to document the icons

-   **[Add a new pricing](add_a_pricing.md#)**  

-   **[Add a new tiered pricing](add_a_new_tiered_pricing.md#)**
