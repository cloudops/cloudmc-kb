# Filters

- Filter: -- Seems like it's required, even though it's not. Could have a label saying "leave blank if no filter desired"

-   Following rule
-   Following expression

- You can apply filters to ignore usage records that you don't want to be processed for your product.

- Filters can be applied to ignore records \(eg, only keep records of Ubuntu templates\)

- Uses a field, an operator, and a value

- What determines the field that's available?

The value in the filter can be pre-populated by the system, but the user can also type in their own value. The pre-populated values are the ones we are aware of that are provided by the service.

- Filters are used to ignore records.

- "Only consider xyz matching the following rules/expressions" <-- What are we trying to tell the user here?
