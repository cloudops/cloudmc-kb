# Sources and attributes

A product is always based on a specific type of *service connection*. A service connection provides raw usage data via *sources* and *attributes*. An source can be thought of as the good that the customer purchases from you, and an attribute can be thought of as the measurable resources associated with that good.

For example, a service connection to a compute cloud platform might provide sources of data such as *Running VM*, *Network usage*, and *Data volume*. A running VM consumes vCPU and memory, therefore these resources would be attributes. Similarly, when a network is used, a measurable number of bytes of data are moved across the network \(or megabytes, gigabytes, etc\). That number is provided by the Network usage source as the *Raw usage* attribute.

\[Example of CDN\] and as attributes, whereas a service connection to a content delivery network would likely provide a count of the number of bytes transferred in a particular region as an attribute.
