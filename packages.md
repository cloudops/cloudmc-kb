# Pricing packages

![Simplified package workflow diagram](Monetization%20workflows%20-%20Frame%204.jpg "Simplified package workflow")

A pricing package, once saved, is applied to an organization by editing the organization and then selecting a pricing package to apply. An organization can have at most one pricing package applied. This means that the pricing package must include products and pricing for all the service connections configured for the target organization, otherwise there will be usage for which the consumer will not be billed.

If I change an organizationâ€™s package, then do a monetization reprocess, do the new credits and discounts apply as well ? discounts and credits are only relevant at invoice generation time. So after doing your reprocess, once the invoice is generated any discounts and credits associated to the assigned pricing package will be applied on the invoice
